# Heart-Disease-Prediction
-> The objective of the project is to predict whether or not a person has heart disease based on his health attributes like resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level etc...

-> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used for data analysis

-> Exploratory Data Analysis is done by visualizing the correlation between various attributes and histograms are plotted to detect outliers

-> Logistic Regression, KNN Clasaifier and Random Forest Classifier are experimented by Hyperparameter tuning and Logistic Regression is chosen based on performance metrics.

-> The model is trained and evaluated for various Evaluation metrics
